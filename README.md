## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
This website is a prototype I developed for my family members' small catering business, CafÃ© Estrella. I designed the site using their logo, brand colors, and aesthetic to create a digital presence that reflects their passion for Latin comfort cuisine.

This project allowed me to apply my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a responsive, user-friendly design that showcases their menu, upcoming pop-up events, and catering services. The goal was to provide a professional yet warm online experience that mirrors the heart of their business.

While this is currently a prototype, it serves as a foundation for a potential fully functional catering website in the future, incorporating features like online ordering, event scheduling, and customer testimonials.
